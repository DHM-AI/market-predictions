"""
AEGIS — Trailing Stop & Partial Exit Manager
Runs every 30 minutes during market hours via GitHub Actions.

Two things happen in every run:

1. PARTIAL EXIT (scale-out) — fires ONCE per position at +7% gain:
   - Closes 50% of the position at market
   - Moves remaining stop to breakeven (entry price)
   - Logs to Supabase so it never fires twice
   - Next run applies trailing stop to the remaining half

2. TRAILING STOP — fires when position is up ≥ 3%:
   - Cancels fixed bracket SL, places Alpaca native trailing stop
   - Tightens as gains grow: +3%→3% trail, +7%→2%, +10%→1.5%, +15%→1%
   - Fractional positions use simulated trailing (fixed stop moved up)

Toggle ENABLE_PARTIAL_EXIT = False in config.py to revert to
single-exit mode instantly.
